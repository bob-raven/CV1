Abstract
Long Distance Relationships (LDRs) are not a new phenomenon. For as long as relationships have existed, diverse reasons for couples living apart have existed, including war, being in the military, migration, working away from home, incarceration and couples who met online, or while travelling, who live in different places. While LDRs are well established, the nature of such relationships remains of interest and is understudied (Sahlstein 2004). For the purpose of this present study, this interest centers around the unique way that mixed-gender, interracial/cultural LDRs both conform, and deviate from societal norms, particularly in terms of challenging existing boundaries commonly seen in Geographically Close Relationships (GCRs). This study draws on social constructionism and ethnomethodology to consider the ways new shared expectations, or boundaries, may be established and maintained in LDRs. Grounded Theory Analysis of in depth interview data suggests that LDR couples are non-conforming and innovative in their approach, allowing for more mutual, less gendered ways of relating that are both culturally aware and intimate.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Long Distance Relationships (LDR’s) are relationships where couples live far apart, perhaps in a different city or country, and are unable to see each other on a regular basis due to distance. By defining themselves as a couple, those involved separate their romantic relationship as unique from other existing relationships. This forms a “mental fence” (Zerubavel, 1991), which helps partners share a mutual understand of the boundaries of their relationship. Boundaries in this case are the shared expectations couples have about how the relationship will function. This may include expectations about gender roles and race for example, but also concerns how couples negotiate the sharing of finances, time and intimacy, among other things. The processes of marking boundaries and creating a joint reality have been studied in Geographically Close Relationships (GCRs) (Berger and Kellner 1964; Richardson 1988; Vaughan 1986), but less is known about the boundaries of LDRs.
Unlike more common forms of relationships, LDRs have fewer established societal norms for relating, and fewer pre-existing relationship roles that guide behavior for both parties. This presents a unique opportunity and an interesting area for study as to how LDR couples establish boundaries and shared understanding. Perhaps the lack of a cultural “blue-print” for long distance relationships allows them to define boundaries in new and innovative ways (Skinner, 2005).
Kolozsvari (2012) showed that the boundaries associated with space (that is, the expectation of a physical presence, and the negotiation of personal space in a relationship) have been seen to become less significant in LDR’s, where, as long as couples shared time together (in the form of synchronized activities and cyber interaction) relationships could be maintained. This was dubbed as “Creative Relational Maintanence” (Kolozsvari, 2012) and may be an enduring feature of LDRs in general. Nippert-Eng (1996) explored the ways in which boundaries are constructed in the work/home sphere. She draws our attention to ritualised behaviours we enact that reinforce boundaries, and how our management of time, space and people can shape our boundaries significantly. This is particularly relevant to LDRs, where boundaries need to be established in the absence of close proximity, and with the added issues of varying work/social schedules that may compete for attention.

The Changing Landscape of Relationships
While LDRs are not new, research does indicate that the number of LDRs is on the rise (Gerstel and Gross 1984; Knox et al. 2002; Cameron and Ross 2007; Pistole, Roberts, and Chapman 2010). In one study, Binstock and Thornton (2003) suggested that about 5-10 percent of married people live apart from their spouse for reasons other than marital discord. There is also a high proportion of university students involved in LDRs (Dainton and Aylor, 2001; Stafford, 2005; Maguire, 2007; Maguire and Kinney, 2010) with some estimates as high as 30 – 50 percent of all college dating relationships being LDRs. (Stafford and Reske 1990; Guldner 1996; Knox et al. 2002; Cameron and Ross 2007; Hill et al. 2009).
Some researchers have mourned the changing landscape of relationships, denoting long distance relationships as a shift towards increasing individualization, and people trying to conform to individualist imperatives (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002 ; Bauman, 2003). Others adopt a pessimistic view of LDR’s suggesting they are an inconvenience to be overcome, or a death blow for an otherwise happy relationship (as seen in Skinner, 2005). Bauman (2003) suggested that without physical proximity, meaningful forms of intimacy are threatened, being replaced by superficial substitutes (e.g. through the use of technology). This is an attempt to maintain a sense of certainty of connection without proximity. However, this argument does not take into account that conceptions of space, place and relationships are socially constructed (Kolosvari, 2012), and can therefore be challenged and innovated. The idea that long distance relationships are somehow unfavourable or inferior need not be accepted by those in them. This study explores participants own perceptions of LDRs, and the way they construct their own boundaries (or “shared reality”). Positive beliefs about their relationship may be a protective factor (Holmes, 2010) against the unique challenges they face, allowing LDR couples to be innovators, rather than victims of circumstance.
This project proposes, in line with research from Holmes (2010) and Kolozsvari (2012), that Long Distance Relationships can teach us a great deal about how the boundaries of human relationships are socially constructed. Furthermore, we may view LDRs as sites of innovation and creativity, where norms and rituals are reshaped and reinvented in the face of new challenges.
Gender, race, and intimacy are all domains of interest within this study. Each will be outlined individually, although there will be considerable overlap between themes, and their intersection is of key importance.
Chapter 2: Literature Review
The theoretical framework for this study was heavily influenced by social constructionism and ethnomethodology.

Social Constructionism

Social Constructionism is a theory of knowledge that challenges positivist notions of truth. Within a social constructionist framework, truth can only exist within a “community of agreement” (Berger and Luckman, 1966). By extension, truths about relationships are also socially created (Berger & Kellner, 1964). Because Social constructionism challenges the idea of objectivity (truth can be empirically proven, independently of the mind), its focus is often on how meaning is created (Marecek, Crawford & Popp, 2004). Meaning is of central importance to discussions about society, and language is seen as playing a central role in the creation of societal norms.

In “The Social Construction of Reality”, Berger and Luckmann (1966) propose that reality is constructed in two ways. Firstly, through institutionalisation and legitimation, it is objectively constructed. Secondly, reality is internalised through socialisation, and is therefore subjectively socially constructed.
These two arenas (the objective and subjective), are useful in discussing relationships, since LDRs may violate a number of objectively constructed societal realities, and can teach us about the way these realities are internalised. For example, marriage is an institution objectively created, and legitimated by the ideology of romantic love. It is subjectively perpetuated when individuals internalise norms about marriage and enact them in their own relationships (Berger and Kellner, 1964). An example of a norm within marriage is co-habitation. Since long distance married couples violate this norm, and possibly other socially accepted norms, it is likely that co-habitation takes on a different meaning for long distance partners. The way in which this meaning is constructed is, therefore, of interest.
This study considers the multiple meanings Long Distance couples create together within their relationships in the form of boundaries. It explores the extent to which such couples adhere to societal norms, or to what degree they create their own norms about relationships. The sample includes inter-ethnic and inter-racial couples, some married, and some unmarried couples, providing information rich data on relationships that cross the boundaries of gender, race, culture and place.
Ethnomethodology
Ethnomethodology is an approach outlined by Garfinkel (1967), which puts the “methods” of a sociological group at the centre of inquiry. In particular, it advocates a principled agnosticism which grants the understandings of the group unique precedence over the researchers assumed knowledge. The knowledge within the group under study supersedes the knowledge of the “expert”, allowing me to join with participants as co-authors in this project.

Garfinkel (1984) also pointed to how group norms are often created and perpetuated without conscious realisation. It is often only by breaching such social norms that they can be elucidated. Breaching social norms is often met with resistance, since they tend to serve an important role in maintaining social order. Because of their rigid nature, those who violate social norms are often viewed unfavourably, and sometimes treated with disgust or violence (Skinner & Hudac, 2017).
While the couples in the sample used by this study are not necessarily attempting to breach social norms intentionally, the unique nature of their relationship leads to a number of challenges that can only be overcome by reinventing certain norms, or disregarding some of them completely.

LDR’s are distinct from GCRs in that the commonly accepted norms and roles that exist for most relationships do not necessarily apply in LDR’s. As Zerubavel (1991) notes, by examining spatial and temporal anomalies we can uncover norms that we tend to take for granted.
A critical review of the relevant literature follows. This is broken into sections of; Gender, Race (and ethnicity) and Intimacy. These areas emerged from the literature as key sights where boundary “work” is done, in society at large, and also within couple relationships.



The Role of Gender in Long Distance Relationships

The central research questions surrounding gender pertain to normative gender roles often found in mixed-gender GCRs. To what extent do couples in LDRs rely on existing gender-normative roles within their relationship, and to what extend do they create their own? Are normative gender roles undone in LDR’s?

Definitions of gender vary, so here the meaning applied in this study is outlined; Gender is understood to be a social category, whose definition makes reference to a broad network of social relations (Haslanger, 1995). Naïve assumptions about gender as a biological given gloss over the socially constructed nature of gender, and the important implications gender has for individuals within society. West and Zimmerman (1987) suggested that gender can be considered in terms of an accomplishment that is achieved through “interactional and micro-political activities”. Gender is therefore not a constant state of being, but is rather a social process that is enacted. By considering the possibly alternative routines and processes through which gender is “done” in LDR’s, we can enhance our understanding of how gender may be done differently.

Gender differences in society

Gender has historically been considered synonymous with biological sex. Essentialist ideas of gender typically presume a predetermined and fixed nature, which is reflected in the binary separation of men and women. A variety of expectations are woven into society, and manifest in romantic relationships. Ideas about gender are often justified through scientific discourses and claimed as “the truth” (Connell, 1995). These may become problematic when they are used to justify men’s dominance in society, for example (Holmes, 2010).

Differences in time and space.

Studies suggest differences in the way men and women’s time and space are viewed. For example, men’s time is traditionally seen as more important than woman’s time (Adam 1995; Bittman and Wajcman 2000; Daly 2002; Epstein 2007; Hochschild 2001, 2003; Lee and Waite 2005; Mattingly and Bianchi 2003; Sayer 2005). In LDR’s, couples need to negotiate time and space challenges regularly (Holmes, 2010, Kolozsvari, 2012). In mixed gender couples, agreements about when and how communicating and visiting take place may reflect gendered perceptions of time and space. For example, is there a balance regarding who is expected to initiate communication and visitation? To what degree is each person expected to sacrifice their time and/or space to facilitate these interactions? The answers to these questions reflect the way gender manifests within the relationship, both in terms of gender role expectation, and the assignment of value in terms of time and space (Kolozsvari, 2012). It is expected that couples in LDR’s are in a unique position to challenge traditional views, and this is likely to reflect in the way they negotiate compromises of time and space.
Gender and Satisfaction
Although some researchers found some gender differences in correlates of relationship satisfaction (Gottman & Gottman, 2017), the majority of research found that similar factors are associated with relationship satisfaction for female and male partners (Impett & Peplau, 2006; Woodin, 2011). According to Holmes (2010) LDRs encourage a rethinking of what relationship satisfaction means, particularly in terms of challenging gender role expectations. She suggests that LDR couples may be less constrained by gendered norms of caring, and are thus able to engage in more mutual forms of emotional support.

Stereotypical gender roles have been shown to be unhealthy for romantic relationships, (Gottman, 1994; Heavey, Christensen, & Malamuth, 1995). Traditional masculinity norms are negatively associated with satisfaction (Burn and Ward, 2005). Studies have also suggested a positive relationship between trait femininity and relationship satisfaction for men and women (Kurdek & Schmitt, 1986; Steiner–Pappalardo & Gurung, 2002). Despite these findings, men appear to be less likely to adopt traits considered as feminine into their self-concept of gender (Di–Dio, Saragovi, Koestner, & Aube, 1996).
Gender and Power
In many traditional relationships, women are socialised to set aside any personal goals and focus first priority on the family (Markham and Pleck, 1986; Shihadeh, 1991). While studies in the migratory behaviour of couples have shown increasing equality in terms of moving/staying power between men and women, it is not clear how this relates to couples in LDRs. Smits et al. (2003) showed that as the balance of power between genders becomes level, other factors, such as age and human-capital begin to play a more important role in the migratory behaviours of couples. How LDR couples negotiate choices around moving, meeting and maintaining their relationship could reflect more than just gender dynamics. Power and influence within the relationship may derive from other factors such as age and financial resources, and this merits exploration in our study.
Race and Ethnicity

Research has also indicated that ethnicity, race and nationality might all have an impact on the nature of LDR’s. Hill et al. (2009) suggested that this was a significant oversight in the LDR literature, but few studies have explored this directly in their research since (See Kolozsvari (2012) for an exception).
Race

It is important to approach discussion of the concept of race care and humility, in light of the wide spectrum of theories that suggest meanings of “race”. A brief theoretical discussion follows.
Social constructionism has, in the past, found itself in ambiguous territory regarding race. On the one hand, social constructionism stands at odds with race realists (Spencer, 2017), who argue for a solely biological basis on which race can determined. But also fall short of race skeptics, who may argue for the immediate abandonment of race and all “race talk” (e.g. Appiah 1995).
This paper found the overview offered by Mallon (2004) very useful in organizing a number of different theories of race and coming to a useable framework for the purposes of this study. In line with his conclusions, the theoretical position of this paper applies the following general explanations of race.

1.	The use of race labels and concepts such as (‘black’, ‘white’) are culturally localised, and have contextual meaning within the site in which they are used. 
2.	These labels impose particular criteria for racial classification. 
3.	The effects of these labels on peoples’ experiences, identifications, and interactions are also culturally and historically local.
4.	The lives of those who fall under these labels can be affected in any number of ways, either through privilege or the negative outcomes of discrimination.

Because of the real-life impacts of race, the decision was made to include it as a concept for analysis. Even as a racial skeptic, Appiah (1996) acknowledges that racial identities can be highly useful, and, at times, essential for members of perceived minority groups.

Discrimination and stress

According to studies conducted in America, interracial couples accounted for only 3% of all newlyweds in 1967. Compare this to 2015, where 17% of new marriages were between partners of a different race or ethnicity (Livingston & Brown, 2017). Like LDRs, interracial and interethnic marriage appear to be receiving growing acceptance, though the challenges and strengths of such relationships, especially in a distance setting, require further inquiry (McElroy-Heltzel et al., 2018).

The work of Foucault (1978, 1979) explained how constructed realities have social and political consequences. Culture can operate at a level that community members are often not conscious of, and so even though truth may be localised and deeply subjective it is assumed to be universal by community members. Those who do not operate according to this subjective truth are viewed negatively by community members, often being seen as misled or ignorant, or in some cases immoral or abhorrent. This can result in social division (Gergen, 2011).

Stress spillover (life stressors impacting relationships) has a significant impact on relationship quality (Randall & Bodenmann, 2009). It has been suggested that racial discrimination may be a unique stressor effecting certain groups, and in turn impacting their relationships. For example, Bryant et al. (2010) argued that everyday discriminatory experiences among African Americans were likely to extend into their relationships (Bryant et al., 2010; Lavner, et al., 2018). In one particularly sobering study, Skinner and Hudac (2017) suggest that interracial couples may elicit disgust and are dehumanized relative to same-race couples. This is particularly concerning given that dehumanized persons can easily become targets of aggression and violence.

While affective bias against interracial couples merits further study, this research focusses more on the positive potential within diverse relationships, where couples participate in creative relational maintenance to overcome the issues arising from racial and cultural differences (Kolozsvari, 2012).

Ethnicity

Couples with different cultural backgrounds have been referred to in the literature as “interracial” (Bell & Hastings, 2015), “intercultural” (Wang, Rankin & Chong, 2015) and “inter-ethnic” (McElroy-Heltzel et al., 2018). A brief discussion of terms is required, since race, ethnicity and nationality are all separate yet overlapping terms. Each term poses a different focus, and in some cases a separate theoretical paradigm. Since race and ethnicity are considered socially constructed concepts with subjective, contextual meaning, definitions change over time (Cokley, 2007). For the purposes of this study, the term “inter-ethnic” will be used, where ethnicity is understood to represent a person’s identified cultural background or backgrounds, and “inter-racial”, where couples personally identify as having different racial identities.

While the role of ethnicity has been studied for couples where one partner has migrated to live within their partner’s culture (Halford et al., 2018), few studies have considered the way culture may operate within a relationship where both partners continue to reside in separate cultures.

It has been suggested that cultural values vary in the extent to which they are vulnerable to change (Halford et al., 2017). Negotiating cross-cultural differences within relationships can be challenging. Although partners tend to become more like each other over time (accommodation effect; Gonzaga, Campos, & Bradbury, 2007) there may be some cultural or familial values that are resistant to change even in close partner bonds. Couples may also experience prejudice from friends and family, and may have difficulty sharing the inter-ethnic relationship status (Brummett & Steuber, 2015; Reiter & Gee, 2008).

Hook, Davis, Owen, Worthington & Utsey (2013) made use of the term cultural humility. This is a relational stance that is other focused, and characterised by a respect and humility towards another individual’s cultural background. Humility in general has been shown to strengthen partner bonds (Davis et al. 2013), and cultural humility may play an important role in the maintenance of inter-ethnic LDR’s.

This study makes use of diverse participant couples including interracial and interethnic couples to address these questions. It offers some needed insight into these diverse relationships as expressed by the individuals involved. How might race and ethnicity interact with distance, and what might this reveal about the boundaries of relationships that span international borders?
Intimacy
What constitutes intimacy, care and relationship satisfaction in GCRs may be different for LDR couples. Maintaining a close, caring and intimate relationship in spite of geographical separation requires an innovative approach. Research suggests that couples in LDR’s are equally satisfied, and in some cases more satisfied with their relationship than GCR couples (Stafford & Reske, 1990). This extends to factors such as levels of trust, commitment and intimacy, which do not seem suffer for most couples in a long distance setting (Dellmann-Jenkins et al., 1994; Guldner & Swensen, 1995).
Communication
One key area that has been shown to thrive in LDR’s and is a key component of intimacy is communication. Kelmer, Rhoades, Stanley, and Markman (2013) reported higher levels of conversational quality, with less dysfunctional communication and psychological aggression between partners in LDR’s. This was also related to stronger feelings of love within the relationship. In another example, Mietzner and Lin (2005) showed that couples developed trust, patience and communication skills because of their separation.
LDR couples need to be creative in their approach to relationship maintenance, sometimes having to finding unusual ways to share experiences. Adam and Groves (2007) speak about a “shared present”, which can today be facilitated through digital communication such as Skype or Whatsapp etc. These applications allow couples to maintain a sense of togetherness by providing this “shared present” (Kolozsvari, 2012). For LDR couples in a military setting, regular communication was identified as essential to the maintenance of their relationship (Carter et al., 2018). Face to face contact still plays an important role for some LDR couples, who report higher levels of trust if they are able to see each other in person at least some of the time (Dainton and Aylor, 2001).
Studies have reported the value of self-disclosure for relationship satisfaction for both men and women (Siavelis & Lamke, 1992; Sprecher & Hendrick, 2004). Reis and Shaver (1988) proposed the interpersonal process model of intimacy. They suggest that intimacy may arise from personal disclosure to a partner who listens and responds empathetically. Mitchell et al. (2008) found support for this notion of intimacy, but identified that self disclosure had different effects according to gender. Men were more likely to feel intimate when they share about themselves, whereas feelings of intimacy in women were better predicted by their partners self disclosure and empathetic listening. Men and women’s experiences of intimacy may be affected differently by self disclosure and empathetic responding (Mitchell et al. 2008).
Commitment
Maintaining a strong social bond between partners is undoubtedly central to the “success” of a relationship, since these bonds tend to motivate individuals to act in the interests of a relationship (Brown & Brown, 2006).
Research has shown that commitment to the relationship was the strongest predictor of relationship stability across relationship “types”, trumping other factors such as love attitudes, sexual attitudes and self esteem (Hendrick, Hendrick, and Adler (1988), Brehm, 1992; Dargie et al., 2015). This is of importance, because gender remains an important mediator of commitment, where women tend to exhibit and express greater commitment to their relationship than men (Sacher and Fine, 1992). In LDRs, studies have shown a similar trend, with women reporting more effort (Schwebel et al., 1992) and initiating more maintenance efforts, such as phone calls, compared to men (Dellman-Jenkins et al., 1994).
Commitment within LDRs is also seen to operate differently than GCRs. High satisfaction and investments were significant predictors of commitment in LDRs, compared to other factors such as low possible alternatives and low commitment avoidance in GCRs (Pistole, Roberts & Mosko, 2010). What this means is that the factors leading to successful LDRs may be different to those in GCRs. It is expected that participants are likely to show high levels of satisfaction and investment in their relationship, however the mechanisms and boundaries of this commitment require further study.
Lydon, Pierce & O’Regan (1997) suggest that there may be different kinds of commitment. Their study highlighted the difference between enthusiastic commitment and moral commitment, with the former being highly correlated with relationship satisfaction, but the latter being associated with meaning and investment in the relationship. The findings showed that moral commitment predicted relationship survival better than enthusiastic commitment. While their study drew important distinctions in kinds of commitment, it did not offer a clear idea of what commitment may mean to LDR couples, which this study hopes to contribute to.
Idealisation
Idealisation is the process through which the positive factors of partners are emphasised, and their faults unconsciously minimised. Idealisation has been shown to strengthen relationships, and decrease the likelihood of relationship breakdown. Perhaps as a result of the challenges faced in LDRs, couples tend to show higher levels of idealisation (Stafford and Merolla, 2007) compared to GCR couples. Stafford and Reske (1990) suggest that LDR couples may focus on the positive aspects of their relationships to justify the difficulty of staying apart. This is supported by the findings of Kelmer et al. (2013) who found that those in LDRs were more optimistic about the future of their relationship compared to GCR couples, despite being equally as likely to break up with their partner. Since rates of separation are seemingly equal, yet rates of idealisation tend to be different, other mechanisms are likely to be at play in conjunction with idealisation within LDRs. Lee and Pistole (2012) showed that idealisation and satisfaction do operate differently in LDRs, being more prominent among insecurely attached partners than others, but not when compared to GCRs. It may also be that LDRs tend to generate "needy" tensions and give the relationship a highly perceived value (Firmin, Firman & Lorenzen, 2014), leading to enhanced cognitive coping strategies such as idealisation.
In summary, this study aims to explore the ways couples in LDRs construct the boundaries (shared expectations) of their relationship. This includes the extent to which traditional gender roles are enacted or challenged, and how couples navigate issues of race and the maintenance of intimacy.
Chapter 3: Methodology

Qualitative Analysis
A qualitative approach to research was adopted. In contrast to quantitative methods, qualitative analysis allows the study phenomena in great detail and depth (Terre Blanche, Durrheim & Painter, 2006). In line with the theoretical position of this research, the meaning that people assign to their behaviour is of central importance. Allowing participants to express their deeper thoughts and feelings brings to the surface richer data regarding their beliefs and values (Marshall and Rossman, 2006). Thus, the meaning of their behaviour can be explored more fully with in depth interviews, where participants can answer questions with freedom, and in a way that does not force them to answer in a manner that may not fit their circumstances (Braun & Clarke, 2006).
Since social construction and meaning are formed primarily through language (Berger and Kellner 1964; Berger and Luckmann 1966; Vaughan 1986), it seemed appropriate to use in depth interviews to draw out information from participants. The language used during the interviews is considered meaningful and becomes part of the analysis (Kolozsvari, 2012).
Participants
Eight Participants, from five mixed-gender couples were interviewed (three couples interviewed individually, and two sole individuals from different couples). The age range was between 26 and 37, and the mean age was 30.8 years. This study made use of the “snowball method” (Salganik & Heckathorn, 2004). Through this method, existing participants are used to recruit other suitable candidates for inclusion from people they know. This process proved effective in sourcing participants who were willing to be interviewed by the researcher. Interviews happened individually on a one to one basis as joint interviews may inhibit participants from acknowledging inequalities within their relationship (Jamieson, 1998; Seymour et al., 1995).

Table 1 - Participant Demographic Information
Materials
An interview schedule was employed to guide each interview (see “Appendix b.”). The schedule assisted the researcher in remaining focussed on the aims of the research, and ensured the collection of broad, information rich data. It was put together following an in-depth literature review, including a critical analysis of interview schedules used in similar studies.
The schedule was developed further during the course of each interview. At the start of each interview, a brief description of the study was given, including the nature of the interviews and how they would be recorded and used in analysis. I invited participants to suggest questions that they felt needed to be asked at any point during the interview, and to ask any questions they had about the process freely. The position adopted by the researcher was that of “co-authoring” the interviews with participants (Kvale & Brinkman, 2009; Kvale, 2007). This approach was informed by the researcher’s theoretical standpoint, where the voice of the participant is given space and respect, and the researcher approaches the discussion as a curious and naïve researcher (Willig, 2008)
The style of the interview was conversational and open-ended. The researcher aimed to establish rapport, and gather descriptive information about the relationship in general, before delving more specifically into key areas of interest. Follow up interviews occurred for two participants, allowing for emerging areas of interest to be explored further.
The researcher took notes during each interview, to highlight areas of interest unobtrusively, to be returned to during analysis. The researcher also attempted to remain conscious of his own biases and assumptions during the interview. The notes proved helpful in flagging particular discourse and constructs that were of interest to the study.
Interviews ranged from 43 to 74 minutes, with some participants being interviewed more than once to explore the research aims more fully. Interviews were recorded using a Dictaphone and transcribed verbatim prior to analysis. The researcher then read and reviewed the transcripts several times. This was done so that the researcher would be very familiar with the raw material in its entirety before beginning analysis. Two participants elected to give their responses in writing, as they were unavailable to be interviewed.
Methods of Analysis
Grounded Theory Analysis sets forth three unique stages for analysing interview data. The first stage; “open coding”, allows the researcher to freely code pieces of data (words, phrases and sentences, for example) into a wide variety of coded categories, or variables. This process is applied to all interview data until the complete data set is coded. When all available data has been coded it is said to have reached a point of saturation, where no further original themes or concepts emerge.
Following open coding, “axial coding” can commence, where codes are reviewed several times until clear themes or ideas are identified that seem to permeate across interviews.  Hypotheses concerning the relationships between identified variables are drawn.
The final stage of analysis involved selective coding, where one variable is identified that is most theoretically saturated, and suitably linked to other variables in an equally meaningful and satisfying way. This becomes what is known as the “core variable” (Glaser 1978; Strauss 1987; LaRossa 2005).
Ethics
Ethical Approval was initially provided by the University of Roehampton Ethics Committee (confirmation received on 25 July, 2018). Following changes made to the design of the study, a second application was made and approved (confirmation received on 11 March, 2019).

Prior to the interview, participants were given consent forms (see “Appendix a.”) regarding the study. At the start of the interview, they were encouraged to ask any questions they had, and another opportunity to ask questions was offered at the end of the interview. To finish each interview, participants were asked briefly how they found the interview process, and if any areas had been particularly difficult or distressing for them to discuss. Additional support was offered in the form of access to support services, but all participants felt satisfied with the processes and did not request any further support.

All participants names and identifying information where changed to protect anonymity. Cities are referred to as “Histown” and “Hertown” respectively according to participants gender.







Chapter 4: Findings, analysis and evaluation.
A number of possible core variables emerged including “together-ness”, “independence”, “female leadership” and “innovation”. The construct of “together-ness” was a core variable that seemed most appropriate for discussion, since it was broad enough to be found across interviews, and specific enough to explore through the lenses of gender, race and intimacy. The way LDR couples construct their own, shared notion of “togetherness” therefore became the focal point of analysis, and was a logical follow on from the theoretical perspective outlined in the introduction.
Aspects of “together-ness”
For the participants interviewed in this study, their shared understanding of “together-ness” was linked to a number of key aspects, common to most of the LDR couples interviewed. These included Communication, Independence, Problem Solving and Shared Goals. As expected, each of these aspects were mediated by gender and race, as well as other factors such as age and income.
This paper set out to explore the way relationship boundaries (shared expectations about the relationship) are constructed. In this sample, this is primarily done through a shared notion of “together-ness”, that may be unique to couples in LDR’s and differ in its meaning from other kinds of “together-ness”. How couples define “together-ness” (and subsequently mark boundaries within their relationship), may extend from the first decision to label (or not to label) themselves as a couple. I began each interview by drawing out a description of the formation of each relationship, and an overview of its history until the present day. Beginning this way set the scene of the relationship, and gave a useful descriptive narrative from which other details could be explored. Participants were free to describe their relationship on their own terms, but were asked to mention characteristics about their partner, and about the nature of their relationship in their description.
Communication
Two of the most prominent functions of communication were maintaining intimacy, and showing care. For many participants, the foundations of the relationship were laid through regular conversations that happened in the months, and sometimes years, preceding it’s official beginning. Communication was found not just to be essential in maintaining LDR’s, but was often seen as the primary cause of the relationship. It is likely that shared expectations about the relationship are established and negotiated through these conversations. Often the “deepest” conversations tended to take place before, or shortly after the boundaries of the relationship were established. This was true for several of the couples interviewed, who reported that relationships developed naturally out of a habit of lengthy, in depth discussions.
Themba: “So we were speaking the whole time. And yah, we basically almost spoke like every single day. And that’s when I was like, yoh this woman. This woman is actually quite nice. From what I know her as. Just speaking every day. I got to a point where I was like, no she’s the one, actually. She’s the one. And, um. We... I won’t say we started dating while she was in Hertown. But towards the end of her contract it was as if we were dating. Because of how we spoke to each other, the things we shared with each other.”

For Themba, the deep manner in which he was able to share with his partner before they were together formed a foundation upon which a relationship seemed a completely natural follow on. For Estelle, deep discussions were also linked to the start of her relationship.

Estelle: “In the beginning we used to speak about all the existential stuff, like … what we believe. What we want with our lives. Like, what we, you know, think our purpose is … in the beginning, that was the sort of, conversation, because it means a lot to both of us…”

The depth and gravity of these conversations is more than just a way to get to know a partner. These discussions facilitate vulnerability, an exposing of deep inner thoughts and beliefs through self-disclosure. They are good examples of early intimacy within the relationship, where physical intimacy is not an option (Kelmer, Rhoades, Stanley, and Markman, 2013).

Estelle: “Yeh, Um. I think because we were having this very extreme like, existential discussions, we both felt exposed to each other, from the get go, like very exposed. I have obviously felt quite vulnerable. So, because of the lack of intimacy, like lack of physical contact, um, that, that need almost felt like more than I think it would be just here. Like that need for intimacy. So, I was just like very communicative with that, I would always just say what I felt.”

This intimacy through communication is an important part of establishing and developing a new LDR. Gender appears to play a role in how these discussions happen. For example, when speaking about their partners, women were more likely to report initiating these kinds of discussions. Some also identified the difficulty their male partners had in self-disclosure. For Charlotte, some of these difficulties were connected to what she perceived as gendered ways of relating.

Charlotte: “I mean that’s who he is, he doesn’t talk about it. Typical male, as well, I think.”

This reference to “typical male” shows an awareness of gendered ways of communicating, and an acceptance that this may be impacting her husband’s attitudes towards sharing. Other participants shared similar experiences, supporting the idea that, even in LDRs, women tend to initiate more communication and maintenance behaviours than men (Dellman-Jenkins et al., 1994).

Estelle: “For Funda it was hard, I think, because he doesn’t like to talk about the intimacy. Or he doesn’t like to talk about emotional things, at all. Whether long distance, or in real time. So, I can imagine that was very hard for him. So, it always felt like I was the one initiating things with that stuff.”

Self-disclosure is a key aspect of intimacy. Mitchell et al. (2008) showed that men have greater feelings of intimacy from personal self-disclosure, whereas women may feel more intimate when their partners share and also listen with empathy and validation. Factors that inhibit self-disclosure could hamper efforts to maintain intimacy in this case, especially if male partners struggle to share.
Estelle: “At times it was a tough hurdle. Because of the lack of physical intimacy, at the start of the relationship, we had to make peace with verbal communication about the lack of intimacy. This was not easy for both of us and sometimes caused friction between us. But what it meant for our current relationship, is an extremely strong sense of knowing each other outside of intimacy, which makes our current intimacy deeper than we could imagine.”
Over time, Estelle and Funda learned to deepen their intimacy through the challenges they experienced. Although initially difficult, the challenges faced seemed to ultimately produce a stronger sense of intimacy in both partners.
Estelle: “It’s actually, like a bit of a Utopia, really I think, because I think when you’re in the same city it wouldn’t go this way, it would take a lot longer to get to a certain agreement, physically, and emotionally and everything if you were in the same city, I don’t know, that’s what I think. Ten to one relationships that I’ve ever been in, if they were in the same city, they never worked out anyways. I think the distance actually allowed me to, yah, do things differently.”
Paradoxically, distance was a catalyst for deepening commitment because of the challenges of intimacy. Communication difficulties may act as a challenge to commitment at an earlier stage in the relationship compared to GCRs, which can fall back on other ways of relating when communication fails. In LDRs, partners must endure communication difficulties and adapt conversations to be mutually satisfying, sometimes by using idealized notions of “together-ness” such as being “everything” to their partner.
Estelle: “This is such a big decision to make and I’m not even near the person, so I want to know everything, so, um, and I wanna, I wanna already take that everything role in that persons life, and visa versa, as much as possible, because you can’t actually be physically together.”
By finding alternative forms of enacting their “together-ness”, couples are able to fast track a strong sense of involvement and importance in each others lives. Charlotte explained this when asked about what her LDR brought to her life.
Charlotte: “And I just, yeh, I feel safe and I feel secure and I feel very much loved, and its nice when someone lives in another country and you feel that way, like, I’ve never felt that way with anybody here so it’s... Yah I think that’s when I was like, yah.”

For some couples, the safety and security they desire can be uniquely found in a distance relationship. This aligns with previous findings that indicate greater levels of love, trust and patience in LDRs compared to GCRs (Kelmer, Rhoades, Stanley, and Markman, 2013; Mietzner and Lin, 2005). Furthermore, these traits seem to develop quickly due to the adaptive nature of communication common in LDR’s (also reported by Kelmer, Rhoades, Stanley, and Markman, 2013)
As the LDRs progress, conversations reportedly take on a more “easy”, “everyday” quality, but this does not diminish their importance. Every-day, even mundane communication, plays a central role in maintaining closeness and keeping in tune with each other.  Raj notes the importance of consistent communication.

Raj: “We have always kept each other close by maintaining a healthy amount of contact over the phone every day. When things got difficult it was generally because it was hard to keep this contact up because of busier schedules over prolonged periods.”

Couples come to know each others’ styles of communicating very well. They are often sensitive enough to identify changes in communication to the degree that even unspoken issues can be addressed. Irrespective of gender, both couples placed a high value of communication, and were sensitive to spoken and unspoken ques.

Themba: “Because of the constant communication that we have going on, Shell say a few things differently, you know, and then I’ll pick up you know, no, whats wrong?… “noo nothings wrong”, and I’ll say no… whats wrong. Because I already know her chatting habits, you know. I already know her chatting habits. If she says one, two, three words and not , one, two, three, four, five, six, seven words. Then I know there’s something wrong. So communication is really, why this relationship is still standing. And its still gonna stand, if the communication is ongoing, you know.”

As long as commitment and communication endure, LDRs provide viable ways of maintaining intimate connections. These connections facilitate a strong, shared notion of “together-ness” that holds high value for both partners. Male participants may be more likely to struggle with aspects of intimate communication (Mithchell, 2008, Di–Dio, Saragovi, Koestner, & Aube, 1996), but this study shows that their contribution to couple communication remains essential to relationship functioning. Their difficulties need not lead to the dissolution of their relationship. Length of time together ranged from ten months to ten years in this study, proving that challenges can be overcome.

Caring/Support

One of the key strengths of communication in LDRs is that they seemingly offer alternatives to normative ways of caring which may be mediated by gender.

Susan: “But then I’ve not always been you know and overly caring, and emotional outwardly physical person anyway to start off with. You know I’m not constantly needing to like be cuddling each other…”

For Susan, showing care through talking may come more naturally than physical forms of affection, even in a geographically close situation. Showing care at a distance may be a welcome alternative for those who’s preferred ways of showing care are not primarily physical or “overly emotional”. As Holmes (2010) has shown, distance can sometimes provide needed relief from expectations about caring, which may also be influenced by gendered expectations. In this case, Susan is able to show care in ways more aligned to her preferences. This may also result in couples sharing the role of caring more fairly. Where traditionally, the “work” of caring may have fallen to women, distance relationships may open an option for more mutual forms of support through talking (Anand et al., 2018).

Interviewer: “And can I ask, with the distance, how do you think you and John show care for one another?”

Susan: “Well for me, on my side, its continuing to show that I care, is at least talking to him, (laughs) yeh. And its, yeh, just continuing to communicate, and at least by sharing what’s going on with him, he knows that he’s still. For me its showing him that he’s still, you know part of my life.”

For Susan, care could be shown through assuring her partner of their place in her life through constant communication. These daily habits of communication assure her partner of their “together-ness”. This communication works both ways, as her partner is often able to support her in much needed ways.

John: “If I see that there’s something, eating her. Cos shell get stressed like this. And then shell tell me, so the cool thing, luckily, about today is, is technology; so were constantly in communication. And I tell her “I’m going to call you now”. Cos I’m good with kind of, reasoning and planning and such. And if I see something isn’t as bad as she thinks it is then I’m able to convince her, of it. So I’ll call and then I’ll tell her, this can’t happen straight way, this is out of your control and, you don’t have to worry about these things, you’re not going to get fired for something, that you did not do. That kind of thing. And then at the end of the day she sees the thing and, like, its, normally short periods of time, she’ll say, yah her boss came in and congratulated her on her good work and now she feels fine and doesn’t worry.”

John is able to reassure his wife and thus support her using technology to communicate whenever necessary. Supportive communication is very much a mutual expectation in LDRs.

Estelle: “What togetherness means... um, I’m old school in that sense, I think Funda is the same, we become one. Laughs. Not really, but, obviously not, but, it’s just we make all the decisions together, um, we’re sad together, were happy together, It’s like yeh we doing things alongside each other and we support each other, first. So, Funda is my first support and my first, comfort, and … he’s the first person who gets that, and who I get it from.”

Even when speaking directly about an issue is unhelpful, alternative ways of showing care are available to those relating over distance. Challenges produced examples of creative relational maintenance for a number of participants. While Charlotte’s partner’s mother was terminally ill, she was best able to offer support by directly keeping in touch with her mother in law, alleviating the burden of emotional care from her husband even in a very difficult situation.

Interviewer: “So while you guys are apart, and both going through a really tough time. How do you show care for each other during this time?”

Charlotte: “Listen, its been a struggle hey. I’m not gonna lie. Um. So I mean I try to just, um, I mean , I uh, obviously we speak every day. He doesn’t like to talk about it a lot because he just says you know it is what it is, she is gonna die, and he’s just like, you know I don’t want to talk about it every day but, I do ask him at least, every second or third day. And then I phone her, so I can chat to her, and make sure that I’m up to date with her and keep everything going. And I think he really appreciates that. He seems to really appreciate that because she doesn’t really have anything else. And so, every day, they speak every day, and it’s good to have a bit of extra support there, and I think that’s really, the best way to actually give the support at the moment. Because, he doesn’t want to sit and talk about it all day” (emphasis added)

Charlotte found that while direct discussions with her husband were not always helpful to him, regular contact with his mother was a supportive act that could make a real difference in both of their lives. As an important act of caring, it also benefitted the relationship indirectly and is an example of a shared commitment within the relationship. To her, “together-ness” extends beyond her husband to his family. Where previous research has shown that women have traditionally been expected to set aside personal goals to care for the family (markham and Pleck, 1986), Charlotte is able to care for her extended family, without sacrificing her own goals.

Independence

Offering emotional support in LDRs is a central part of being “together”, but may differ from more conventional ways of supporting in GCR’s. For example, an underlying expectation that individuals are ultimately responsible for resolving their own problems was apparent in several interviews.

Raj: “You still have a certain amount of independence and autonomy for which you are responsible for. Of course you get support emotionally from the other person if say for instance you are going to a difficult time but ultimately have to overcome these situations by yourself still.”

The balancing of “independence” and “responsibility” is a key to how LDR couples construct the boundaries of their togetherness. Independence is seemingly highly valued in LDR’s with many participants reporting this as one of the primary benefits to going Long Distance.

Interviewer: “What do you enjoy about being in a LDR?”
Elsa: Independence in combination with belonging. Having time in your life to build your own character and being okay with spending a lot of time alone.”
It’s important to note that independence and togetherness are not mutually exclusive. In fact, there were multiple examples of increased commitment and intimacy following independence.

Susan: “I mean what I enjoy about it is, I suppose that I continue to get to do what I want to do. And he’s supportive of what I want to do. So for us that’s something I, specifically enjoy about our relationship, not long distance relationships in general. But at least our relationship is, you know, he’s very supportive about what I’m doing.”
For many participants “Getting to do what I want to do” is a freedom afforded by few other kinds of relationships, especially when “what I want to do” is related to a career that requires travelling. When both partners are highly supportive of each other’s independence, they are more likely to enjoy aspects of being apart. As Raj put it;
Raj: “LDRs are enjoyable in … that you deal with less relationship-based day-to-day admin due to you simply not being in the same space geographically.”
Finance

Themba: “Because, with my tradition, obviously the man should provide…, but Um, with the kind of relationship that I’m currently in. I won’t say I’m obliged to provide like my culture says I should.”

Financial independence was a common theme among participants. LDRs put partners in a position where it is sometimes impossible to share finances due to living in different countries. Financial independence is therefore a reality that most LDR couples face and may allow for less traditional practices of managing money as a couple (Holmes, 2010). For Themba, the boundaries concerning provision in his current relationship stand in contrast to traditional expectations placed upon him.

Themba: “…It does say that a man should provide for his family, and that has come to me through, through the way I, I was raised by all these different people. My culture says that, but I feel that it should be that way for me as well because of, because of how, how I’m wired basically. But um, gradually, very gradually I’m snapping out of that. Especially because, because of how Amy tells me I should. Cos, I should be able to, um, ask for help, well especially from her because I’m in a relationship from her. I should be able to because she’s trying to get me to. Or try to show me ways to get to that point, I’ll probably just have that going with her, if I do eventually get comfortable with it at some point…”

LDR’s provide a positive alternative to traditionally gendered norms about money in relationships. In Themba’s case, his partner is instrumental in helping him change traditional attitudes that he feels are unhelpful, but which are resistant to change. His description of an evolving inner narrative is profound, where the meaning of provision within his relationship can change from “A man should provide” to “I should be able to ask for help”.

Themba: “Like I would always wanna pay, for our bills and, you know, always. And then she would sometimes insist on some like, “no, no no no, you need to allow me, you need to snap out of that tradition or culture or mindset that you have. If I have the money to pay for this, I will. And if you don’t have the money to pay for that, you should get to a point where you sort of, feel comfortable”. It’s very difficult for me, feel comfortable to let me, sort stuff out. You know.”

The psychological struggle of change may be related the fact that traditions of gender are most often internalized from family and other important cultural origins. These deeply internalized views are unlikely to spontaneously shift, but do show signs of change in the context of the Long Distance Relationship. The boundaries of gender seem clearer in GCRs than in LDRs. Historically, men were seen as “bread-winners”, who provide materially for their families by offering a “roof over their head”. While women were financially dependent on their partners and adopted a nurturing and supportive role (Markham and Pleck, 1986; Shihadeh, 1991). This notion stands in contrast to LDRs, where couples live apart and are often financially independent of each other. For those who were married, partners tended to remain financially independent for day to day expenses and living costs but a disparity sometimes arose at the prospect of a geographically close future, where, in some cases, one partner had taken responsibility of future financial security. In Susan and John’s case, this fell to Susan, who’s income was greater.

Susan: “Okay, so I mean the truth of the matter is I make a significant amount more money than he does. So the one, kind of, more responsibility that I have is more, our savings, for the future. And what I’ve been doing is saving so I can buy a house. … um, but I have no problem with the fact that I’m the one that’s saving up money for us for a house. And stuff like that, that’s fine because I understand that I make a significant amount of money, where he does not, and um, so, but I’ve always been very independent in doing my own thing and having my own money, so that will always remain the same. And yah that is kind of non-traditional, I am the main, bread winner of the family I guess.”

For Susan, adopting a non-traditional approach to finances was seemingly completely natural. Her role as provider of future security was easily accepted by her and her partner, because she “makes a significant amount of money, where he does not”. By being the main bread winner of the family, Susan also maintains her financial independence which is very important to her. Age may also be an important factor here, with the majority of power over final decisions for John and Charlotte being made by their respective older partners, regardless of gender. As previous research has suggested (Smits et al., 2003) regarding power within romantic relationships, when traditional boundaries of gender are changed, other factors, such as age and financial status come into play. With nearly 9 years between them, Susan’s established career and life priorities could remain uncompromised by her relationship, as long as her husband was willing to “adapt” to her lifestyle.





Problem Solving

Dealing with Racism
While most presenting problems were commonly addressed individually with partner support, there were certain problems that inter-racial LDR couples faced that were a direct result of their togetherness, and needed to be dealt with as a team. All participants in this study had partnered with someone from a different cultural and often racial back round. Many interviewees reported little to no issues related to their inter-racial, or intercultural relationship. However, in some cases, encounters with close family members proved challenging. Themba and Amy found that there are sometimes racial and cultural barriers to family approval, specifically from Amy’s mother.
Themba: “In our case, she wasn’t expecting her daughter to date a black Zulu, a black Zulu guy. Wasn’t expecting that… for her. I can’t say she’s racist, because, um, she didn’t say that she can’t. But, like, her idea of her daughter seeing someone, wasn’t a black Zulu guy.  I don’t know what it was, but I don’t know. That’s what we kind of have going on now. But I love this girl, and I know she loves me just as much, and I’m not gonna, sort of, speak bad of her mother, … I don’t know what the case may be, but I choose not to speak against it and be on some kind of, “um Amy your Mom can’t be like this”. I’m not in a relationship with her mom. If her mom chooses to be the way that she’s being then so be it…”
Discriminatory experiences have been shown to spillover and effect intimate relationships (Bryant et al., 2010; Lavner, et al., 2018). How individuals navigate their experiences of discrimination within their relationship may mitigate the effects of this spillover. For Themba, his approach to dealing with apprehensions based on race was to deescalate the conflict, and to focus on his partner, rather than on the family or the problem. This is may be helped by distance, where parents and extended family or friends are less involved in the relationship because of practicality and lack of proximity. This may afford LDR couples a measure of control over interference from people outside their relationship. The boundaries of their relationship can be shifted to insulate them from the harm of problematic attitudes, even when they involve important family relationships. Using humour to further defuse a potential conflict had a positive outcome within Themba’s relationship, and is linked to research showing the importance of positive humour on relationship satisfaction (Hall, 2017).
Interviewer: “Is her mom’s attitude difficult? how does Amy feel about her mom’s attitude?”
Themba: “She told me today that she feels very upset. And she said she felt better after talking to me about it because she expected me to react differently, and so she felt much better when I reacted the way that I did. Cos I was like, yah, you know your mom. In fact you know what I said to her? I cracked a joke I said, it’s unfortunate that I can’t bleach myself, I said. The only thing, the least I can do is forge an accent for your mom (laughs). And that sort of, made her feel better, and I was like, nah listen, its not a big deal. If your mom feels that way then she feels that way. Maybe she’ll get around some day. And that’s what she’s hoping for.”
Turning potentially harmful attitudes into moments that deepen understanding and comfort reinforces the shared sense of “together-ness”. This suggests that partners in LDRs employ sophisticated conversational methods to emphasize their “together-ness” as distinct from other important relationships in their lives (e.g. “I’m not in a relationship with her mom.”).
Funda and Estelle also faced challenges of acceptance, but in a broader way.
Estelle: “I learned a lot about the city I was staying in, as Funda… would visit me in Hertown often. Hertown is the most racist city we both know, and we only figured this out fully when we started dating each other. The white mentality in Hertown is extremely problematic and not one that we feel comfortable to be a part of. Histown, on the other hand, although far from perfection in this regard, doesn’t meet the “experienced” racist numbers that Hertown does in our experience...”

Speaking as a couple emphasizes their togetherness amidst the challenges of being an inter-racial couple. Estelle referred to “inappropriate glares, questions and overcompensation” as some of the challenges she and her partner experienced. Goss (2018) showed that interracial couples and families deal with being “Hyper-visible” at the same time as “incomprehensible” to many onlookers due to normative ideas about what kinds of people “belong together”. Their long distance status proved to be revealing of cultural attitudes seemingly imbedded within Hertown (Hook et al., 2013).

Feeling uncomfortable in Hertown, Estelle and Funda made a decision to eventually reside together in Histown, which they felt was comparatively better. This cultural awareness was facilitated by their distance relationship, and may not have occurred if they had both been residing in the same city. Meanings of culture and race change over time (Cokely, 2007) and LDR’s could enable better awareness of cultural norms related to race that inhibit equality, creating opportunities for individual growth and personal awareness.
Shared Goals
Interviewer: What does it mean that you two are “together”?

Charlotte: “I suppose it’s the goal that’s keeping us together at the moment because were both working for the same thing.”
Future Investment
A reoccurring view of LDR’s as an investment for the future has been documented in previous studies (Arditti & Kauflñnan, 2001; Magnuson & Norem, 1999) and was also commonly mentioned by participants in this study. The Investment Model (Rusbult, Martz, & Agnew, 1998) suggests that joint investments facilitate commitment within romantic relationships, which is the best predictor we have that a relationship will survive.
Being together, at a distance, is a costly investment both emotionally, and financially. LDR partners must spend time and money on maintaining communication, financing two separate living arrangements and travelling to see one another. These costs would be ultimately lost in the dissolution of the relationship, and as such are tied into the overall investment. While GCR couples may invest in shared possessions (property, cars, sentimental objects etc.) to demonstrate and promote commitment, LDR investments such as travel and communication expenses could supplement GCR investments, and contribute to relationship commitment for those relating over distance. LDR couples may also invest emotionally and financially in shared goals.
Charlotte: “Yes, Intially you know we were trying and seeing what was going on you know, for the first year. And then you after the first year obviously, of travelling back and forth, you go Okay, well, is it worth spending all the money, on the flights to Germany, and on the visas and him coming here, or not? And so then we were like, okay so this is the plan…”
Although visiting each other regularly was the ideal, it was not always financially viable. By developing a shared goal for the future, LDR couples may find a way to endure longer periods of not visiting each other. For many participants, the shared goal of cohabitation acted as an alternative to regular visits. Having a long term goal was a sentiment echoed by Charlotte’s father.
Interviewer: “And did your parents, or did his mom, ever talk to you about the fact that you guys were doing it, sort of a long distance thing?

Charlotte: “Actually no, no, um. You know the most my Dad said, he just said to me you know you guys just need to have a plan in place, you know, long term because, you can’t carry on being long distance for the rest of your life, so yah, so. Luckily we have a plan and its in place so, we just gotta follow through with it.”

With the majority of couples planning to cohabit at some point in the future, the negotiation of where, when and how couples would eventually live together seemed to be dependent on a number of things, including work, family and cultural factors. Gendered cultural norms surrounding romantic relationships have been documented in cohabiting couples. Furthermore, men and women have reportedly different apprehensions around cohabitation (Huang, 2011).

Future plans to live together usually entailed one person relocating to reside with their partner, as opposed to both partners finding a new place together. Generally, the women in this study said that they planned to move from their existing home to cohabit with their male partners. However, there were marked exceptions, especially when partnerships were headed financially by women. For Raj and Elsa, who had been together, at a distance, for almost 10 years, the decision was made to eventually settle in Sweden, where Elsa already had an established career. Similarly, John and Susan were planning to live somewhere determined by her work opportunities.

Equality was an important value stressed in many interviews, with efforts seemingly made to maintain a mutual investment in the relationship regarding travel and living costs. However, LDR couples inevitably face moments where their future goals or desires differ, and sometimes sacrifices are made to resolve these matters. Examining who is expected to sacrifice what tells us more about the meanings that people in LDRs ascribe to sacrifice.

Sacrifice

Sacrifice was a common theme amongst participants. Often this related to discussions about future plans around cohabitation and having a family. This meant that couples spent time negotiating sacrifice and coming to agreements related to events that would happen in the sometimes distant future.

Smaller examples of sacrifice can be found in the compromises couples make during decision making. Among co-habiting couples, disparities seem to exist between who initiates and determines important decisions. Sassler and Miller (2011) reported that women were more likely to adopt a passive role, often waiting for male partners to take initiative. This study found a different narrative in LDRs, with partners seeming to enjoy a more equal share of decision making power, playing to each other’s strengths.

Funda: “Either myself or Estelle has more say, depending on experience around the decision, strengths and weaknesses, and some other factors that would play a role in the decision. However, we don’t tend to make a decision until both of us have reached a consensus on the matter.”
In some cases, women reported more decision making power than their partners. With Elsa reporting “driving” the outcome of important decisions. For Susan and John, the picture was also noticeably less traditional, with decision making power falling largely to Susan and being driven primarily by her career and her age.
Susan: “Uhhm, it wasn’t really a discussion as much as it was like, me telling him this is how it could happen. Yeh, Basically I don’t know… I guess, you know, I’m the boss *laughter*.”
Because Susan was “older” and had “been doing what I’ve been doing for a long time” she reported: “I know what I want to do, and what I want to continue doing”. Her clarity around her career aspirations remain uninhibited by her relationship, because the boundaries of their “together-ness” were established early on.
John: “That’s the one thing that we agreed on. We will never expect one another to sacrifice. Like if I wanted to, like I am, basically, staying in my industry, I’m gonna do that and if and she’s gonna go wherever she needs to go… That was settled quite early in the relationship…”
Distinctions have been made regarding motives behind sacrifice (Cooper et al., 2017), with self-serving or relationship-serving motives seemingly eliciting less gratitude than partner-serving motives. However, this framework over simplifies people’s motives to wholly selfish, or wholly altruistic. LDR couples seem to experience sacrifice differently, and ascribe more fluid meaning to it. The sacrifice of being apart may be seen as an investment in a geographically close future (Rusbult, Martz, & Agnew, 1998), but may also be a mutually beneficial experience in the present. Rather than being “either/or” scenario, where one partners needs must suffer for the other, sacrifice can be perceived as a nonzero sum game where both partners win. As this study has found, the shared expectation of independence made for mutual career benefits, without harming the sense of togetherness couples share.














Chapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations

This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that couples in LDRs innovate positive alternatives to existing, normative ways of relating. The constructed notions of being a LDR couple seemingly have numerous benefits for those involved. Participants also constructed alternative meanings regarding separation, such as normalising it, and perceiving it as beneficial to intimacy and lifestyle.

The strength of communication in LDRs offers the potential for sophisticated approaches to problem solving and relationship maintenance. It was also found to deepen intimacy, even in couples where partners initially struggled to engage in self disclosure, which is a reported threat to intimacy in GCRs.

“Together-ness” may be the ultimate goal for many couples in LDRs, but this “together-ness” represents not just an idealized goal of cohabitation, but a powerful and immediate experience of partnership that has daily advantages. This includes an appreciation of independence within their relationship. Couples in this study were able to engage with, and rise above racism, distance, family differences, career commitments, and a host of challenges, because of the high value individuals place on their “together-ness” and the skills they developed within their relationship.

Participants demonstrated an ability to create a new shared reality that is potentially different to their culture of origin, and indeed the cultures each of them currently reside in. This shared reality is strengthened by their relationship, and the joint cultural awareness that long distance couples share. Because each couple in this study featured partners from distinct cultural or racial back rounds, it may be that this sample demonstrates uniquely what is possible when the shared reality of “together-ness” exists in addition to each partner’s geographically local reality.

Finally, the experiences documented in this study point to a healthy interdependence, and multiple examples of more mutual, less gendered ways of supporting and caring for one another.


Recommendations

One of the key weaknesses of this study is its broad areas of interest. Because of its exploratory nature, this study was limited in its ability to delve deeply into certain topics. For example, future studies may focus more directly on the specific impact of financial independence, age and gender in LDRs.

Another weakness of the study was its small and limited sample group. Participant age range is a concern, and a disproportionate number of participants were South African, due to the method of recruitment used. Future studies could choose to include older participants, from more diverse backgrounds, who have likely developed further innovations not seen in this study due to their experience.

Finally, future studies could extend the idea of LDR couples as innovators. By the time this report was completed, several of the interviewed couples had begun living together. It would be interesting to study the extent to which the innovations and skills developed over distance are carried over into cohabiting relationships and whether the benefits of LDRs continue after cohabitation.

Appendix b.

Interview Schedule

The aim of this questionnaire, is to help me understand more about long distance relationships, and the experience of people involved in them.

Long Distance Relationships are becoming increasingly common, and are often good examples of relationships that transcend and challenge the traditional expectation of cohabiting. Similarly, partners from different cultural back grounds often face unique experiences in their relationship.

I’m particularly interested in the ways that your relationship might deviate from a number of societal norms (ie. gender norms, work expectations/attitudes, cultural expectations etc.)


1.	Descriptives –

•	Please describe the start of your relationship with your partner, from the time you first met, until the present time. Include as much detail as you can, and be sure to comment on the characteristics of your relationship (e.g. “We have a caring and nurturing relationship…”) and the qualities of your partner (e.g “She works long hours”).


2.	Race, Ethnicity and Nationality –

•	What discussions have you had with family and friends about your relationship? What do they think about your relationship?
•	What do they think about you being interethnic/interacial?
•	Are there any challenges you’ve faced being and interethnic/interracial couple?
•	How was being in a long distance relationship effected your experience of being interethnic/interracial?

3.	Negotiation -

•	When visiting occurs, who tends to travel more to visit? How often does this happen?
•	What circumstances led to your living apart? What sort of discussions did you have leading up to the separation?
•	When making important joint decisions, who do you feel has more say over the final decision? Why is that?
•	Please describe your financial situation. (e.g; Do you share money/have a joint account or are you entirely financially independent from each other?)

4.	Intimacy –

•	How do you feel living apart has shaped or affected your relationship?
•	How do you maintain intimacy with your partner when you are apart?
•	How do you and your partner show care for each other?

5.	Satisfaction –

•	What is most difficult about being in a LDR?
•	What do you enjoy about being in a LDR?
•	Are you aiming to live together with your partner at some point in the future?
•	Finally, what does your relationship bring to your life presently?
